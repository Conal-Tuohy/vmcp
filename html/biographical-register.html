    <h1 id="biographical-register">Biographical register</h1>
    <p>It provides short accounts of the lives of individuals mentioned in this edition of Ferdinand von Mueller’s correspondence. It comprises newly written entries, shown in black text, merged with an amalgamation of the entries included in the appendices to the three volumes of Home <em>et al.</em> (1998-2006). These earlier entries, shown in blue text, are subject to further revision and correction as biographical information has become more readily available since they were prepared. Any hyperlinks in them have not been checked. Newly revised entries appear in black text.</p>
    <p>Names of correspondents are being added in tranches as they are completed; they are sorted into alphabetical order within the whole file. Priority is being given to entries for Mueller's correspondents. The date of the most recent update is given in the note.</p>
    <p>In the revised entries hypertext links, if available, are provided where a major source is used. For newspapers, especially, the link may be to a section of a page that contains other material as well as the item concerned. Neither the editors nor the Royal Botanic Gardens are responsible for the stability of such links. Preference has been given to sites using persistent links, such as <em>doi</em>, <em>permalink</em>, or <em>handle</em> URLs, and to links not behind a paywall, although if access is not available elsewhere links to sites commonly available through institutional or personal subscription are provided, for example to <em>JSTOR</em> and <em>ProQuest</em>. Links to the <em>HathiTrust Digital Library</em> are provided only if at the time of linking the item is available without geographical restriction. In a small number of cases, links have been provided to publicly available versions placed by authors in depositories; such links are provided on the understanding that authors have deposited items within the copyright or contractual arrangements they have with their publishers. If evidence of inappropriate deposit is found, these links will be removed.</p>
    <p>In the revised text recipients of letters from Mueller or authors of those to him for whom basic biographical information has not been found are included, with a note to the period when they were known to be active. Entries are not provided, however, for other individuals mentioned in fewer than three letters for whom no further information could be found. These are mostly persons known only from lists of donors of living material or herbarium specimens, or recipients of such exchanges, that are published in Mueller’s reports to Government. Letters where people mentioned have not been identified normally have a note ‘not further identified’. Individuals mentioned in three or more letters for whom incomplete data are available are entered in the directory, with an indication of when they were active.</p>
    <p>Where Mueller named plants after a person mentioned in the letters, the names originally given are in italics following the entry. If the current name is different synonyms are not provided but can be found in APNI under the entry for the name Mueller gave.</p>
