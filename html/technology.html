		<h1>Technology</h1>
		<p>The software for this website was developed for the Gardens by <a href="https://github.com/Conal-Tuohy">Conal Tuohy</a>, a freelance software 
		developer based in Brisbane.</p>
		<p>There are two parts to the system:
			<ul>
				<li>a <a href="https://github.com/Conal-Tuohy/VMCP-upconversion">batch conversion process</a> which converts the 
				corpus of more than 10,000 items of Mueller's correspondence from Microsoft Word format into 
				<a href="https://tei-c.org/guidelines/">TEI XML documents</a>, and</li>
				<li>a <a href="https://github.com/Conal-Tuohy/vmcp">web application</a> which organises and presents the resulting TEI 
				XML files in the form of this website.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>The batch conversion process uses <a href="https://help.libreoffice.org/7.4/en-US/text/shared/guide/start_parameters.html">LibreOffice</a> to
		convert the Microsoft Word documents into OpenDocument format, and then further processes those OpenDocument files into TEI XML using a
		sequence of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/">XSLT 3.0</a> stylesheets, organised in an 
		<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xproc/">XProc 1.0</a> pipeline.</p>
		<p>This website is also a pipeline written in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xproc/">XProc 1.0</a> language, consisting mostly of 
		<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/">XSLT 3.0</a> stylesheets. The pipeline handles requests from web browsers, reading TEI XML files, 
		submitting queries to the search engine,	and formatting pages into HTML. </p>
		<p>The XProc pipeline is hosted by a Java web Servlet called <a href="https://github.com/Conal-Tuohy/XProc-Z/">XProc-Z</a>, which in turn is 
		hosted in the Java web server <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</a>. The web application uses 
		<a href="https://solr.apache.org/">Apache Solr</a> as a search engine to drive the search and browse interface, and to perform hit-highlighting. </p>
