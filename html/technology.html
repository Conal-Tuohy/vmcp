		<p>The software was developed for the Gardens by Conal Tuohy, 
		a freelance software developer based in Brisbane.
		There are two parts to the system:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/Conal-Tuohy/VMCP-upconversion">a pipeline</a> which converts more than 10,000 items of Mueller's correspondence 
				from Microsoft Word format into TEI XML documents,</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/Conal-Tuohy/vmcp">a web application</a> which publishes the resulting TEI XML files as a searchable website.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>The high level structure of the web application is a pipeline written in the XProc 1.0 scripting language. Within the XProc pipeline, 
		the TEI XML files and HTML pages are processed using XSLT 3.0 stylesheets. The XProc pipeline is hosted by a Java web Servlet 
		called <a href="https://github.com/Conal-Tuohy/XProc-Z/">XProc-Z</a>, which in turn is hosted in the Java web server Apache Tomcat.</p>
		<p>The web application uses the Apache Solr to as a search engine to drive the search and browse interface, and perform hit-highlighting. </p>
