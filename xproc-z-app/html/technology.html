		<p>There are two parts to the system driving this database:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>a <a href="https://github.com/Conal-Tuohy/VMCP-upconversion">batch conversion process</a> which converts the corpus of more than 10,000 items of Mueller's correspondence from OpenDocument format into <a href="https://tei-c.org/guidelines/">TEI XML documents</a>, and</li>
		<li>a <a href="https://github.com/Conal-Tuohy/vmcp">web application</a> which organises and presents the resulting TEI XML files in the form of this website.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The batch conversion processes those OpenDocument files into TEI XML using a sequence of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/">XSLT 3.0</a> stylesheets, organised in an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xproc/">XProc 1.0</a> pipeline.</p>
		<p>This website is also a pipeline written in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xproc/">XProc 1.0</a> language, consisting mostly of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/">XSLT 3.0</a> stylesheets. The pipeline handles requests from web browsers, reading TEI XML files, submitting queries to the search engine, and formatting pages into HTML.</p>
		<p>The XProc pipeline is hosted by a Java web Servlet called <a href="https://github.com/Conal-Tuohy/XProc-Z/">XProc-Z</a>, which in turn is hosted in the Java web server <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</a>. The web application uses <a href="https://solr.apache.org/">Apache Solr</a> as a search engine to drive the search and browse functionality, and to perform hit-highlighting.</p>
		<p>The software for this website was developed for the Gardens by <a href="https://github.com/Conal-Tuohy">Conal Tuohy</a>, a freelance software developer based in Brisbane.</p>
		<p>The website software is based on software originally developed for the Indiana University website <a href="https://newton.dlib.indiana.edu/">The Chymistry of Isaac Newton</a>.</p>
